# Smart-Traffic-Management-System

The purpose of this project is to create an algorithm to reduce the traffic congestion in real life time. In the traffic management system ,these system takes traffic density as input from the road cameras in each lanes of the road  which is abstracted from image processing technique (open cv module and random forest algorithm) in raspberry pi, resultantly giving output as effective signal management.

### **MODULES :**

- Traffic density
- Detecting congestion
- Manage traffic signal
- Updating traffic light timing

### **Traffic density :**
 
The lane vehicle captured through the cameras and gave as input to the Raspberry.in the raspberry they detect the density of the vehicle in the lane through open cv module and image processing technique.

### **Detecting congestion :**

In this system , detect which lane have high traffic density through the random forest algorithm.

### **Manage traffic signal :**

By the analysis of all the lane vehicle,the STMS algorithm reduce the delay time of the signal in the appropriate lane and manage the signal effectively.

### **Updating traffic light timing :**

These system analysis the density of the lane vehicle for some duration and automatically updating the delay time of the signal that means the traffic congestion high on particular lane that have short delay time in the traffic signal.
